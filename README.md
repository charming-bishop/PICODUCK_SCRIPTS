# PICODUCK_SCRIPTS
Scripts from my Raspberry pi Pico rubber ducky project

	Created a Keystroke injection tool with a Raspberry pi Pico and created payload1 and 2 to give it the functionality of deactivating antivirus in a target computer, installing keyloggers, stealing Wi-Fi passwords, and downloading backdoors to get a reverse shell on a target computer.

instructuctions on how to create the keystroke injection tool can be found here:
